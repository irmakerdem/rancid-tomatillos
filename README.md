### Introduction
Rancid Tomatillos is a mash-up between IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and any movie database that comes to mind, but on a much smaller scale! A user is able to view all movies in card format on the homepage; clicking on a movie card or selecting alphabetically by movie title from the dropdown directs to another page with additional movie details. On a given film's movie page, you can see a movie's main poster, backdrop image, and a few other little details about the selected film. Click around and explore all 40 films! üé¨

### Learning Goals

- Learn how to test React components & asynchronous JS
- Practice refactoring
- Create a multi-page UX using Router

### Technologies
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- API fetch
- React
- React Router
- Cypress

### Reflection
- React makes it so much faster to spin up an app! There was definitely a learning curve to figuring out how components should be structured and how data should be passed around - making a diagram before actually writing any code was incredibly helpful. React syntax was a bit of an adjustment overall but team very quickly got used to it!  
- Team had difficulties making MovieDisplay a functional component and opted to make it a class component. Also, when refactoring with React Router, team struggled initially when the conditional rendering using a ternary had to be discarded along with any event listeners. 
- Cypress üìù testing was very exciting to perform for the first time! Although it was easy to maneuver around the E2E window/UI, some of the methods were tough to utilize (e.g. find, select) specifically with the dropdown. Initially, team had a hard time testing for existence of images.
- Team utilized a Determine the Relationship (DTR) document detailing team collaboration expectations and stayed true to what was agreed upon for entire duration of the project! ‚ù§Ô∏è
